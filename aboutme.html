								<p>I am a Mechanical Engineer raised in Torrance, CA, with my BSME from Johns Hopkins University. I love figuring out complex mechanisms, disassembling anything I can get my hands on. I went to a STEM high school (California Academy of Mathematics and Science), where I fell in love with engineering. Here I was able to learn firsthand how to operate CNC machines and joined the VEX robotics team where we were able to compete at the state level.</p>
								<p>Eventually, my love for engineering took me to Johns Hopkins University, where I was able to learn from the best professors on how to transfer my passion into the real world. Here, I learned the fundamentals of manufacturing -- CAD, DFM, mill, laser cutting, casting, soldering, welding -- just to name a few (see more in <a href="resume.html">Resume</a>).</p>
								<p>During my time as an undergraduate student, I had an internship with Goleta Star, where I was able to learn how to apply what I learned in academia. The team did not have a mechanical engineer, and so one of my first assigned projects was to install a laser cutting machine, learn how it operated, and teach how to properly use the machine to the team. This was an important step as they were planning to move onto production. My next task for the next month was to research and develop a more efficient heat sync design for their radar's PCB board housing that also has a smaller mass than the current design. Through continuous thermal simulations using SolidWorks, I was able to provide a much more efficient design. My last project was to CAD various testing fixtures so that untrained coworkers can easily test various electrical components of the Radar. This ultimately saved the company thousands of dollars as they did not have to hire a contractor to confirm the functionality of the electrical components. One of the biggest skills I've acquired through this internship was to be proactive and autonomous.</p>
								<p>Outside of engineering, I love to stay active. If I am not working on projects, you can find me playing basketball, soccer, tennis, bowling, or pickleball. If you are interested, I would love to connect with you. My LinkedIn can be found above or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlee1221/">here</a>.</p>
