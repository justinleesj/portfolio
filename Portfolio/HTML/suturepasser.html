                                <p>In this project, my team and I worked with TIGON Medical to improve their current design of the suture passer. Through our investigation, we found that inefficiencies stemmed from the friction caused by the needle as it traversed through the passer. Through much brainstorming, prototyping, and testing, we've concluded to pursue three improvements.</p>
								<p>The first improvement was to redesign the lower jaw (as shown in the left end of the image). By increasing the radius of curvature, we decrease the area of contact between the needle and the jaw and apply less stress on the needle. This not only helps solve the friction issue but it also tackles another problem: the needle tip breaking. Through our own testing, we've noticed a common point of breakage in the needle tip caused by the stress created as the needle's path goes from horizontal to vertical.</p>
								<p>The next improvement was to sharpen the needle further than it already was. Through online research backed by our own testing, we found the optimal needle sharpness for rotator cuff surgeries to be about 35 degrees. The current needle design was sharpened at around that angle, however, it was only sharpened along one axis. By introducing a secondary axis in which the needle is sharpened, this facilitates penetration into the rotator cuff tendons. Through this solution, we effectively reduced the Force required to puncture the tendon in half.</p>
								<p>Lastly, we explored utilizing material properties. Using Ashby's Granta Edupack, we saw why TIGON Medical and other medical companies use Nitinol as their choice of material for needle tips. It is a metal alloy that has a low modulus of elasticity. In other words, the material can be easily deformed which helps it traverse through the suture passer. One material property that TIGON Medical did not utilize was utilizing <a href="https://www.kelloggsresearchlabs.com/2018/01/09/cause/">Nitinol's shape memory effects</a>. After training the material to remember a certain orientation, if we mechanically deform the material and then heat it to the transition temperature, the material will return to the taught orientation.</p>
								<p>This project was the closest to working in the "real world" and taught me how to work alongside a sponsor. </p>
