                                <p>For this project, we were given a series of 2D CAD drawings, as well as an overall assembly drawing. To manufacture the components, I utilized the lathe and mill machines, as well as sand casting. To ensure a smooth surface finish, I used low- and high-grit sandpaper, deburring tool, and needle nose pliers.</p>
                                <p>Creating this project has taught me invaluable lessons. It has taught me how to read drawings and the importance of the order in which components are machined. Another key takeaway is to design for manufacturability as this saves so much re-work on the mill and lathe machines. The last technical lesson was to always pay keen attention to finish as slight asymmetries killed the performance of the flywheel's rotating capabilities.</p>
                                <p>Outside the technical aspect, I took away many lessons. For instance, machine-shop scheduling played a big role in the completion of the project not just for me but for my peers as well. It is very difficult for over 100 students to use one machine shop. But by staying organized with scheduling, not only can all of the students use the machines without waiting but also we would always have at least 2 people in the shop at all times in case of any emergencies. Through this project, I got a better sense of lead-time estimations and clear communication.</p>
